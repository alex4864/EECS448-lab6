1. isEmpty() does not properly determine empty lists, and seems to always return
true
2. AddBack() appears to be inserting elements into the front, or at very least
not in the correct position
3. Both RemoveBack() and RemoveFront() do not seem to be updating the count of
elements in the list
4. RemoveFront() does not remove elements from the correct position, and seems
to be removing them from the back
